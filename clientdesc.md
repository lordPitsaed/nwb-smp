## Description
This modpack provides various optimization improvements, as well as graphic enhancements like shaders, distant horizons, and a few useful resource packs. Keybinds and mods are preconfigured, with no further tinkering needed.
Its planned to maintain this modpack as long as possible, so you will always have a nice fresh modpack as soon as possible after Minecraft updates.

## Performance
## OUTDATED. Tested on 1.21.1. Will provide test sometime later, sry.
Used Terralith as world gen mod and Chunky to measure chunk gen performance.

- <b>Time from main menu to in-game:</b> 22.745342 seconds
- <b>Total time to load game and open world:</b> 54.641342 seconds
- <b>Average Chunky gen rate:</b> 10-15cps (Can be higer with [c2me](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric), but I don't want to listen how my friends are struggling and whining about Java 22 requirement)
- <b>Shader/No-shader performance:</b> 65fps/143fps(VSync) (Can be improved with [nvidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/nvidium), wont add because its incompitable with DH and latest iris) <br>
