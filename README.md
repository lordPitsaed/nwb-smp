## Description
This modpack provides various optimization improvements, as well as graphic enhancements like shaders, distant horizons, and a few useful resource packs. Keybinds and mods are preconfigured, with no further tinkering needed. Its planned to maintain this modpack as long as possible, so you will always have a nice fresh modpack as soon as possible after Minecraft updates.
